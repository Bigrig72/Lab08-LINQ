# Lab08-LINQ

## New York City Neighborhood- Using LINQ to query neighborhood 

In this Lab I have built a main menu that will give you options to view the neighborhoods in Manhattan in different ways using LINQ.
## How this works--Menu options--
1. View all neighborhoods in the JSON file
2. Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
3. Remove the Duplicates from the neighborhood list
4. Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.

## What it looks like in action (Visuals)
